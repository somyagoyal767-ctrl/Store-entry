PROBLEM STATEMENT:

This project aims to develop a Python-based Online iOS Apple Store that simulates an e-commerce shopping experience for Apple products. The system should allow new users to create accounts through a secure signup process and enable existing users to log in and access personalized services. Once authenticated, users can browse a catalog of Apple products, select items to purchase, and receive an automatically generated, itemized bill summarizing their order.



OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based console application that simulates an online iOS Apple Store, allowing users to browse and purchase Apple products.The goal of this project is to provide a functional, user-friendly, and interactive console application that demonstrates key e-commerce functionalities such as user authentication, product selection, transaction handling, and receipt generation.



SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

This project uses the tabulate module to present product details in a clear table format and the datetime module to display the current date and time during billing. Through developing this application, I learned how to implement user signup and login systems, manage data using lists and dictionaries, and organize code using modular functions. I also gained experience building a functional shopping cart, calculating totals and GST, and generating a detailed bill. Additionally, this project helped me understand how external modules enhance user interaction and how real-world e-commerce logic can be applied in Python programs.




TARGET USERS:

All the users who are above the age of 18 and can make their own financial decisions on how and where to spend their money.



FEATURES:

This project offers a range of features designed to simulate the core functions of an online Apple Store. It includes a detailed user authentication system where new users can sign up by providing their information, and existing users can securely log in to access the store. The application provides a structured catalog of Apple products, allowing users to browse through available items along with their prices. Users can select products, specify quantities, and proceed to make a purchase through a simple and interactive console interface. The system calculates the total cost automatically and generates a complete, itemized bill at the end of the transaction, displaying product names, prices, quantities, and the final payable amount. These features collectively demonstrate essential e-commerce functions such as account management, product browsing, cart selection, and billing within a Python environment.
